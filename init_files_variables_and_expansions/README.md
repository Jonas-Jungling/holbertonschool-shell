## Shell Initialization Files
Shell initialization files are scripts that are executed when a shell session starts. These files can be used to configure the shell environment.

## Variables
Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated within the shell. You will learn how to create, modify, and use variables.

## Expansions
Expansions are a way to manipulate and transform data in the shell. This section covers different types of expansions such as parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and more.

## Usage
